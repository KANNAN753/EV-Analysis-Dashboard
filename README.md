# EV Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

The EV Analysis Dashboard is an interactive visualization developed using Power BI to explore and analyze electric vehicle (EV) data. It showcases key metrics such as vehicle distribution, ownership trends, and types of EVs across different regions. This project utilizes a dataset sourced from Kaggle to provide clear and actionable insights for stakeholders.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Electric Vehicle Population Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/electric-vehicle-population). It includes the following columns:

- **VIN (1-10)**: Vehicle Identification Number
- **County**: County of the vehicle's registration
- **City**: City of the vehicle's registration
- **State**: State of the vehicle's registration
- **Postal Code**: Postal code of the vehicle's registration
- **Model Year**: Year the vehicle model was manufactured
- **Make**: Manufacturer of the vehicle
- **Model**: Model of the vehicle
- **Electric Vehicle Type**: Type of electric vehicle (e.g., Battery Electric Vehicle, Plug-in Hybrid)
- **Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility**: Eligibility status for clean alternative fuel vehicle incentives
- **Electric Range**: Electric-only driving range of the vehicle
- **Base MSRP**: Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price
- **Legislative District**: Legislative district of the vehicle's registration
- **DOL Vehicle ID**: Department of Licensing Vehicle ID
- **Vehicle Location**: Latitude and longitude coordinates
- **Electric Utility**: Electric utility provider
- **2020 Census Tract**: Census tract information

## Features

- **Vehicle Distribution**: Visual representations of EV distribution across various regions.
- **Ownership Trends**: Analysis of EV ownership over time, highlighting growth patterns.
- **Vehicle Types**: Breakdown of different types of electric vehicles in the dataset.
- **Electric Range Analysis**: Insights into the electric-only driving ranges of various EV models.
- **Price Analysis**: Examination of the base MSRP of different EVs to understand market segmentation.

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel**: For initial data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Power BI**: For developing interactive visualizations and dashboards.
